# Karate Chop

This file is a Python solution to the Code Kata proposed by Dave Thomas.

The kata can be found here:

http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_two_karate.html

Within the file there are five seperate solutions to the problem posed
in the kata.

They are:

* Recursive Search
* Iterative Search
* Threaded Search
* Traditional Binary Search
* Tree Search

I am sure these are not the only solutions. 
They might not even be the best solutions.

I suggest you give the kata a try and see if you can't figure out a 
better way of solving it than I did.


# Running unit tests

To run the unit tests and view that the solutions in the file work,
simply run the file

python karateChop.py
